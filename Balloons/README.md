This program will generate and draw a random number of hot air balloons in a new JFrame window. <br>
They will fly up as a group and have a randomized "wind" drift that pulls them left or right as they rise. <br>
The program also creates a JSlider that allows the user to control the speed at which they rise (can be negative speed which would make the balloons fall down).
